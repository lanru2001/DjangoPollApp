## Django Polls App (Dockerized)

In this branch of the repository, the Django project code has been modified to work in a Docker-based environment, as described in [How to Build a Django and Gunicorn Application with Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-django-and-gunicorn-application-with-docker).

Sensitive variables in the `env` file have been scrubbed. Instructions for filling in these configuration variables are available in the accompanying DigitalOcean [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-django-and-gunicorn-application-with-docker)
